= New Features

* The jdbc/mysql adapter now supports the newer
  com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver driver.  The adapter will still attempt to
  load the older com.mysql.jdbc.Driver if the com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  is not found.

= Other Improvements

* When testing a connection after creating a new Database instance
  raises an exception, the Database instance is removed from
  Sequel::DATABASES.

* The single_table_inheritance and prepared_statements plugins now
  work correctly if loaded into the same class.

* Database connect and disconnect errors are no longer swallowed when
  calling Database#create_or_replace_view, Database#server_version
  on PostgreSQL, or Database#create_table* on Oracle.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Previously, instantiating a new Database instance directly using
  Sequel::Database.new did not test the connection by default.  That
  was instead handled by Sequel::Database.connect.  The test
  connection now happens inside Database#initialize.  This should only
  affect backwards compatibility for code that is calling
  Sequel::Database.new directly.
