= New Features

* Dataset#with_ties has been added on PostgreSQL 13+ and Microsoft
  SQL Server, which will have a limited dataset also return all
  rows with the same order as the final row.

* In the pg_json_ops extension, the following methods have been
  added to Postgres::JSONBOp, all of which require PostgreSQL 13+:
  
  * #set_lax
  * #path_exists_tz!
  * #path_match_tz!
  * #path_query_tz
  * #path_query_array_tz
  * #path_query_first_tz

* On Oracle, the Database#view_exists? method now accepts a
  :current_schema option to limit the views returned to the
  current schema, instead of all non-system schemas.

= Other Improvements

* Sequel will now pass keyword arguments through in the following
  cases:

  * When loading plugins (Model.plugin)

  * Class methods automically defined for methods defined in a
    Model.dataset_module block

  * Methods defined by Plugins.def_dataset_method

  * Database methods called inside migrations

  * Methods called via an association proxy when using the
    association_proxies plugin.

  * Dataset methods called inside a Dataset#query block when using
    the query extension.

  Previously, keywords were not handled in these cases, which would
  cause deprecation warnings in Ruby 2.7 and ArgumentErrors in Ruby
  3.0.  Note that Sequel itself does not use keyword arguments at
  all, so all of these changes only affect cases where external
  methods are defined that accept keywords, and Sequel methods are
  called with keywords that end up being delegated to the external
  methods.

* The odbc adapter will now stream result sets instead of loading
  the entire result set in memory and then iterating over it.

* Sequel now recognizes another disconnect error in the mysql and
  mysql2 adapters.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Due to the odbc adapter change to use streaming, issuing queries
  inside a Dataset#each block will no longer work unless a different
  shard or thread is used.  The behavior of such code is considered
  undefined on all Sequel adapters.
