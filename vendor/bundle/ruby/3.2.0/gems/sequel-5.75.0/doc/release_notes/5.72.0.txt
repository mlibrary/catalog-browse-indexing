= New Features

* A pg_auto_parameterize_in_array extension has been added, which
  handles conversion of IN/NOT IN to = ANY or != ALL for more types.
  The pg_auto_parameterize extension only handles integer types by
  default, because other types require the pg_array extension. This
  new extension adds handling for Float, BigDecimal, Date, Time,
  DateTime, Sequel::SQLTime, and Sequel::SQL::Blob types.  It can
  also handle String types if the :treat_string_list_as_text_array
  Database option is present, using the text type for that. Handling
  String values as text is not the default because that may cause
  issues for some queries.

= Other Improvements

* The defaults_setter plugin now does a deep copy of database
  default values that are hash/array or delegates to hash/array.
  This fixes cases where the database default values are mutated.

* Sequel now correctly handles infinite and NaN float values used
  inside PostgreSQL array bound variables.

* The data in the cache files used by the schema_caching and
  index_caching extensions and static_cache_cache and
  pg_auto_constraint_validations plugins are now sorted before the
  cache file is saved, increasing consistency between runs.

* bigdecimal has been added as a dependency.  bigdecimal is currently
  a default gem in Ruby from 1.9 to 3.2, but it will move to a
  bundled gem in Ruby 3.4, and there will be warnings in Ruby 3.3
  for cases that will break in Ruby 3.4.  Adding bigdecimal as a
  dependency should avoid warnings when using bundler in Ruby 3.3,
  and should avoid errors in Ruby 3.4.
