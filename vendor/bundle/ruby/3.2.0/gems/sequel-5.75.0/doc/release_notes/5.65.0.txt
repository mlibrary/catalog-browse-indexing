= Improvements

* The pg_auto_parameterize extension now uses a modified placeholder
  literalizer for speeding up the generation of SQL queries in the same
  cases where a standard dataset would use a placeholder literalizer.
  This can provide a 4% speedup for simple queries, with greater
  speedups for more complex queries.

* Database#indexes now returns indexes for partitioned tables on
  PostgreSQL 11+.

* MySQL versions not supporting CHECK constraints no longer include
  :min_value/:max_value schema entries for decimal/numeric columns.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The Dataset::PlaceholderLiterlizer::Record.loader API has changed,
  it now accepts the Dataset::PlaceholderLiterlizer class to use as
  the first argument.  This makes it easier to create
  Dataset::PlaceholderLiterlizer subclasses, such as the one now used
  by the pg_auto_parameterize extension.
