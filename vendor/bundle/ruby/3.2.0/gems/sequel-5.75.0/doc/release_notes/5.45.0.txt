= New Features

* A auto_validations_constraint_validations_presence_message plugin
  has been added that provides integration for the auto_validations
  and constraint_validations plugin in the following conditions:
  
  * The column has a NOT NULL constraint
  * The column has a presence constraint validation with both
    the :message and :allow_nil options used.

  In this case, when saving a nil value in the column, the plugin
  will make it so the more specific message from the presence
  constraint validation is used, instead of the generic message
  from auto_validations.

= Other Improvements

* On SQLite 3.35.0+, Sequel now uses ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN for
  dropping columns, instead of emulating the dropped column by
  recreating the table.

* The Dataset#with :materialized option is now supported on SQLite
  3.35.0+ for specifying whether common table expressions should be
  materialized.

* The odbc adapter now correct handles boolean columns with NULL
  values.  Previously, such values were returned as false instead
  of nil.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The change to use ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN on SQLite 3.35.0+ can
  cause backwards compatibility issues if SQLite 3.35.0+ does
  not allow dropping the column.
