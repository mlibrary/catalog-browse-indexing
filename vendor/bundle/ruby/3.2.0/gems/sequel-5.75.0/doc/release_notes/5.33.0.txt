= New Features

* Custom join types are now supported on a per-association basis when
  using eager_graph/association_join.  This builds on the previous
  support for custom aliases, using Sequel::SQL::AliasedExpression:

    class Artist < Sequel::Model; end
    class Album < Sequel::Model; end
    class Track < Sequel::Model; end
    Artist.one_to_many :albums
    Album.one_to_many :tracks
    Artist.eager_graph(
      Sequel[:albums].as(:a, join_type: :inner) =>
        Sequel[:tracks].as(:t, join_type: :left)
    )

* A Database#current_timestamp_utc accessor has been added on SQLite.
  Setting this to true will keep CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIME, and
  CURRENT_DATE in UTC instead of converting them to localtime.

= Other Improvements

* The smallserial PostgreSQL type is now recognized and Sequel will
  not try to mark smallserial columns as identity columns.
