= New Features

* An adapter has been added for the trilogy MySQL driver. One large
  advantage over mysql2 is that trilogy does not require any MySQL
  client libraries installed on the machine. The trilogy adapter
  has basically the same issues/skipped specs as the mysql2 adapter,
  but it also does not support an application_timezone different
  than the database_timezone.

* Model dataset modules now have a model accessor, allowing for
  code such as:

    class Foo < Sequel::Model
      dataset_module do
        where :kept, Sequel[model.table_name][:discarded_at] => nil
      end
    end

= Improvements

* The mysql adapter now works with ruby-mysql 4 (the pure-ruby
  MySQL driver).  Note that multi-results support does not work
  with ruby-mysql 4 (it doesn't work with mysql2, trilogy, or
  other Sequel adapters in general).

* Warnings for unsupported flags are now avoided on ruby-mysql 3.
