= New Features

* The validation methods added by the validation_helpers plugin now
  support the :skip_invalid option, which will not add a validation
  error on a column if it already has a validation error.  This can
  be useful if you want to avoid having duplicate errors.

* The auto_validations plugin now supports a :skip_invalid plugin
  option, which will pass the :skip_invalid option when calling
  validation methods.

= Other Improvements

* The :adder, :remover, and :clearer association options now
  support keyword arguments in Ruby 2.7+.

* In the pg_interval extension, Sequel now uses the same number of
  seconds per month and seconds per year as active_support.  It
  originally used the same number, but active_support changed the
  values in active_support 5.1.  Sequel now uses the active_support
  values if they are available.

* When adding a String column on PostgreSQL, an explicit text: true
  option now takes precedence over an explicit :size option, as it
  does in Sequel's default behavior.
