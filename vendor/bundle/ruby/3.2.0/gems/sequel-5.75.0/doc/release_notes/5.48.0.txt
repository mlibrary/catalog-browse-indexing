= New Features

* A Sequel::Database#like_without_collate accessor has been added on
  Microsoft SQL Server, which avoids using the COLLATE clause for
  LIKE expressions.  This can speed up query performance significantly.

* A private Sequel::Model::Errors#full_message method has been added
  to make it easier to support internationalization for Sequel::Model
  error messages.

= Other Improvements

* The association reflection tracking in the unused_associations
  plugin now works correctly when combining coverage runs.
