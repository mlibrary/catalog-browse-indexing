= New Features

* An auto_restrict_eager_graph plugin has been added for automatically
  disallowing the use of eager_graph with associations using blocks but
  lacking graph_* options.  This can prevent potentionally invalid usage,
  as the restrictions added by the block are not used by eager_graph.

* The sqlite adapter now supports the :setup_regexp_function
  Database option. This option will define a REGEXP function in the
  database that will allow regexp support in queries, such as:

    DB[:table].where(column: /(some|pattern)/)

  Note that this creates a Ruby Regexp object per column value tested,
  so it isn't the most optimal approach. 

= Other Improvements

* Calling dataset aggregate methods such as #max on a model dataset now
  works correctly. Previously, it could fail if called enough times to
  optimize using a placeholder literalizer.
