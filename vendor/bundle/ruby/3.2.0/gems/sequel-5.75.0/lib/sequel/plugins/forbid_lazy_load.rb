    # The forbid_lazy_load plugin forbids lazy loading of associations
    # for objects in cases where the object wasn't loaded with a
    # method that only returns a single object.
    #
    # The main reason for doing this is it makes it easier to detect
    # N+1 query issues. Note that Sequel also offers a
    # tactical_eager_loading plugin which will automatically eagerly
    # load associations for all objects retrived in the same query
    # if any object would attempt to lazily load an association. That
    # approach may be simpler if you are trying to prevent N+1 issues,
    # though it does retain more objects in memory.
    #
    # This plugin offers multiple different ways to forbid lazy
    # loading.  You can forbid lazy loading associations for individual
    # model instances:
    #
    #   obj = Album[1]
    #   obj.forbid_lazy_load
    #   obj.artist # raises Sequel::Plugins::ForbidLazyLoad::Error
    #
    # +forbid_lazy_load+ is automatically called on instances if the
    # instances are loaded via a method such as Dataset#all,
    # Dataset#each, and other methods that load multiple instances
    # at once.  These are the cases where lazily loading associations
    # for such instances can cause N+1 issues.
    #
    #   Album.all.first.artist
    #   objs.first.artist # raises Sequel::Plugins::ForbidLazyLoad::Error
    #
    #   Album.each do |obj|
    #     obj.artist # raises Sequel::Plugins::ForbidLazyLoad::Error
    #   end
    #
    #   Album[1].artist # no error
    #
    #   Album.first.artist # no error
    #
    # You can allow lazy loading associations for an instance that it
    # was previously forbidden for:
    # 
    #   obj = Album.all.first
    #   obj.allow_lazy_load
    #   obj.artist # no error
    #
    # You can forbid lazy loading associations on a per-call basis,
    # even if lazy loading of associations is allowed for the instance:
    #
    #   obj = Album[1]
    #   obj.artist(forbid_lazy_load: true)
    #   # raises Sequel::Plugins::ForbidLazyLoad::Error
    #
    # This also works for allowing lazy loading associations for a
    # specific association load even if it is forbidden for the instance:
    #  
    #   obj = Album.all.first
    #   obj.artist(forbid_lazy_load: false)
    #   # nothing raised
    #
    # You can also forbid lazy loading on a per-association basis using the
    # +:forbid_lazy_load+ association option with a +true+ value:
    #
    #   Album.many_to_one :artist, forbid_lazy_load: true
    #   Album[1].artist # raises Sequel::Plugins::ForbidLazyLoad::Error
    #
    # However, you probably don't want to do this as it will forbid any
    # lazy loading of the association, even if the loading could not
    # result in an N+1 issue.
    #
    # On the flip side, you can allow lazy loading using the 
    # +:forbid_lazy_load+ association option with a +false+ value:
    #
    #   Album.many_to_one :artist, forbid_lazy_load: false
    #   Album.all.first.artist # no error
    #
    # One reason to do this is when using a plugin like static_cache
    # on the associated model, where a query is not actually issued
    # when doing a lazy association load.  To make that particular
    # case easier, this plugin makes Model.finalize_associations
    # automatically set the association option if the associated
    # class uses the static_cache plugin.
    #
    # Note that even with this plugin, there can still be N+1 issues,
    # such as:
    #
    #   Album.each do |obj| # 1 query for all albums
    #     Artist[obj.artist_id] # 1 query per album for each artist
    #   end
    # 
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclasses support forbidding lazy load
    #   # (called before loading subclasses)
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :forbid_lazy_load
    #
    #   # Make the Album class support forbidding lazy load
    #   Album.plugin :forbid_lazy_load
